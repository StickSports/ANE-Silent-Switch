h1. Air Native Extension for iOS Silent Switch

This is an "Air native extension":http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/native-extensions-for-air.html for the hardware silent switch on the iOS platform.

This extension enables the hardware silent switch on the phone to mute sounds that are played in an Air project. The extension has a single command that mutes all currently playing sounds. We have mot found a way to mute sounds that will be played, only sounds that are playing, so for full silent-swicth functionality you should call the method in this extension immediately after playing any sound.

h3. Version

This is version 0.1 of this extension.

h3. Binary files

The bin folder contains the compiled extension and the default swc, which can be used for local testing if required by your development environment (Flash Builder shouldn't need it, but other IDEs may).

h3. Building

Requirements - Adobe Air SDK 3.1 or later, XCode IDE, iOS SDK 5.0 or later, Flurry Analytics iPhone SDK

* Add the FlashRuntimeExtensions.h file from the Adobe Air sdk to the ios/SilentSwitchIosExtension folder in the project.
* Create a copy of the build/example.build.config file in the build folder, calling it build.config and change the properties in this file to match your system.
** A certificate is required by the build script. This may be a self-signed certificate created by Adobe Air.
* Run the ant build script build.xml. This creates the native extension and default swc file inside the bin folder.
